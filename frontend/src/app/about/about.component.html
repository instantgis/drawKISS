      <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a developer and traditional artist based in Mauritius. I work with pencils (5H to 14B)
        and Indian ink, creating urban sketches, botanical illustrations, and visual stories
        about my island home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being color blind, I've embraced achromatic art—focusing on light, form, and the
        texture that only hand-drawn cross-hatching can provide.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        My old workflow was painfully slow: Take a photo on my phone. Email it to myself. 
        Download it on my laptop. Open Affinity. Add a grid layer. Convert to black and white. 
        View it fullscreen next to my easel. Grid my paper. Then finally... draw.
      </p>
      <p>
        All that friction was killing my momentum. I wanted to <strong>draw more</strong>, 
        not manage files.

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>drawKISS</strong> automates the boring parts. Snap a photo, apply filters 
        (edges, posterize, threshold), overlay a grid, and start sketching immediately. 
        The reference appears on my Mac screen, gridded and processed, ready for my easel.

      <h2>Tech + Art in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        As AI-generated imagery becomes ubiquitous, the "imperfections" of hand-drawn art 
        are becoming a premium luxury. The texture of paper, the weight of a 14B pencil, 
        the visible cross-hatching—these are proof of human presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tool helps me get to the human part faster. Less tech friction, more ink on paper.
