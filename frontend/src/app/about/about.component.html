      <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Alain d'Espaignet</strong>, a developer and a Dodo with a natural ability
        to draw, based in Blue Bay, Mauritius. I work with pencils (5H to 14B Corinne sent me), charcoal and Indian ink,
        creating urban sketches, botanical illustrations, and visual stories about my island home.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        Being color blind, I've embraced achromatic art—focusing on light, form, and the
        texture that only hand-drawn cross-hatching can provide.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>My old workflow was painfully slow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roam around Dodo land</li>
        <li>Spot a subject</li>
        <li>Take a photo on my phone</li>
        <li>Email it to myself</li>
        <li>Download it on my laptop</li>
        <li>Open Affinity</li>
        <li>Add a grid layer</li>
        <li>Convert to black and white</li>
        <li>View it fullscreen next to my easel</li>
        <li>Grid my paper</li>
        <li>Then finally... draw</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All that friction was killing my momentum. I wanted to <strong>draw more</strong>,
        not manage files.
      </p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p><strong>drawKISS</strong> automates the boring parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Snap a photo</li>
        <li>Apply filters (edges, posterize, threshold)</li>
        <li>Overlay a grid</li>
        <li>Start sketching immediately</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The reference appears on my MacBook Air attached to my easel, gridded and processed, ready to draw.

      <h2>Tech + Art in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        As AI-generated imagery becomes ubiquitous, the "imperfections" of hand-drawn art
        are becoming a premium luxury. The texture of paper, the weight of a 14B pencil,
        the visible cross-hatching—these are proof of human presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tool helps me get to the human part faster. Less tech friction, more ink on paper.

      <h2>Built with AI</h2>
      <p>
        I challenged <a href="https://www.augmentcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Augment Code</a>
        to build this entire app with me—deadline: January 3rd, 2026. We started at 4pm on
        January 1st and shipped everything (and more) by midnight. <strong>~4.5 hours of actual work</strong>,
        two days early. 🎉
      </p>
      <p>
        Human vision + AI execution = more time drawing, less time debugging.

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>Do you find this app useful? Should I add more filters? Let me know!</p>
      <p><strong>Coming soon:</strong> the ability to photograph your work in progress and final pieces—so you can document your journey from reference to finished art.</p>
