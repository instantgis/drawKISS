# 10 Commandments

## You have full access to the database using pgkiss see top level package.json and scripts\db\use-vps-supabase.ps1
## When changing database schema generate the sql so it persists then run it using pgkiss
## Verify your changes using pgkiss
## You change the database schema, you regenerate the types see top level package.json script types:generate
## You change code you rebuild and check for errors, find the build scripts and be in the right folder
## Never guess SQL queries tables/columns when you have all types in frontend\src\types\drawkiss.ts
## Conform to the design system established in frontend\src\styles.css, no scattered css values in components all over the place
## Conform to Angular practices in frontend\README.md
## Never guess, if you don't know research it online
## Don't guess, you waste my tokens. Software development is an exact science. You don't guess your way though it.
